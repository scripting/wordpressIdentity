# wordpressIdentity

Implements <a href="https://developer.wordpress.com/docs/wpcc/">OAuth identity</a> with wordpress.com for Node.js apps.

### It works

You can try it out <a href="http://scripting.com/code/wpidentity/client/">here</a>.

It doesn't do anything but log you on or off, for now. 

### Check out worknotes

For now, while this is in active development, all the action is in the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/wordpressIdentity/blob/main/worknotes.md">worknotes</a>. 

### Automattic docs

### Still to do

8/30/23 by DW: Make it an NPM package so it can easily be included in other apps.
